# my-sodastream-dashboard

Dashboard to monitor the use of a Sodastream.

## Backend

Node.js API using MongoDB to store data.

## Frontend

Single page application using React & Redux. I started from a [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/) theme and created my custom components to display charts and other data.
